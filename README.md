_**This repo contains the custom installation packages required by the Arduino IDE (version 1.6.4 or newer) to install the WisBlock Arduino BSP's and the RAKwireless RUI3 BSP's.**_

There are two installation packages available:
- `package_rakwireless_index.json` is for WisBlock Core module support in Arduino IDE v1.6.4 or newer.
- `package_rakwireless_com_rui_index.json` is for RUI3 support in Arduino IDE v1.6.4 or newer.

----

The difference between the two packages:
| Arduino BSP | 	RUI3 | 
| -- | -- | 
| Open Source | 	API is prorietary RAK code and not published | 
| Uses SX126x-Arduino library MAC stack V1.0.2 | 	Uses RAK MAC stack V1.0.3 | 
| Class A and C | 	Class A, B and C | 
| Has FreeRTOS (RAK4631/RAK11200) | 	Barebone SDK code | 
| lowest power consumption ~30uA (RAK4631) | 	lowest power consumption ~6uA | 
| Adopted from available open source BSP's | 	Developed by RAK R&D team | 
| Supports RAK4630, RAK4631, RAK11310 and RAK11200 | Supports RAK4630, RAK4631, RAK3172, RAK3172 EVB, RAK3272 Breakout Board, RAK3172-SiP, RAK3272-SiP Breakout Board |
| Uses open source bootloader | Uses RAK proprietary bootloader |
